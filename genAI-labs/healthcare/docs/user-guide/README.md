**General Health Question:**

You: What are the symptoms of diabetes?
AI: Common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and frequent infections. However, it's important to note that this information is for educational purposes only. If you're experiencing these symptoms, please consult with your healthcare provider for proper evaluation and diagnosis.

**Medication Question:**
```
You: Can I take ibuprofen with my blood pressure medication?
AI: Ibuprofen can potentially interact with some blood pressure medications, particularly ACE inhibitors and diuretics. It may reduce the effectiveness of these medications and could increase the risk of kidney problems. I strongly recommend consulting your pharmacist or healthcare provider before taking ibuprofen with your blood pressure medication to ensure it's safe for you.
