# Diabetes Management Guidelines

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2.

## Type 1 Diabetes

### Description
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin. It typically develops in children and young adults, but can occur at any age.

### Management
- **Insulin Therapy**: Required for all patients with Type 1 diabetes
- **Blood Glucose Monitoring**: Regular monitoring throughout the day
- **Carbohydrate Counting**: Essential for proper insulin dosing
- **Regular Exercise**: Helps improve blood glucose control
- **Healthy Eating**: Balanced diet with consistent carbohydrate intake

### Target Blood Glucose Levels
- **Fasting**: 80-130 mg/dL (4.4-7.2 mmol/L)
- **Post-meal (2 hours)**: <180 mg/dL (<10.0 mmol/L)
- **HbA1c**: <7% (53 mmol/mol)

## Type 2 Diabetes

### Description
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. It typically develops in adults over 40, but is increasingly seen in younger individuals.

### Management
- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Diet and exercise are the foundation of treatment
- **Oral Medications**: Metformin is typically the first-line treatment
- **Injectable Medications**: GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors
- **Regular Monitoring**: Blood glucose and HbA1c testing
- **Patient Education**: Understanding the condition and self-management

### Target Blood Glucose Levels
- **Fasting**: 80-130 mg/dL (4.4-7.2 mmol/L)
- **Post-meal (2 hours)**: <180 mg/dL (<10.0 mmol/L)
- **HbA1c**: <7% (53 mmol/mol)

## Complications

### Short-term Complications

- **Hyperglycemia**: High blood sugar
- **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**: Life-threatening condition

### Long-term Complications
- **Cardiovascular Disease**: Heart attack, stroke
- **Nerve Damage**: Diabetic neuropathy
- **Kidney Damage**: Diabetic nephropathy
- **Eye Damage**: Diabetic retinopathy
