## üéÆ Your First Exercise

Let's start with a simple exercise from Module 1 (Customer Service):

1. **Access the platform** at `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Navigate to Module 1** (Customer Service)

3. **Start Exercise 1**: "Basic Customer Inquiry Handling"

4. **Follow the instructions** to interact with the supervisor agent

5. **Observe how** the supervisor delegates to specialist agents

## üîß Understanding Agent Architecture

### Basic Agent Structure

Every agent in the platform follows this structure:

```python
class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config: AgentConfig):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Initialize agent-specific components
    
    def _create_tool(self, tool_name: str):
        # Create and return tools
        pass
    
    async def execute_task(self, task: str, parameters=None):
        # Execute specific tasks
        pass
```

### Key Components

- **Agent Config**: Defines the agent's behavior and capabilities
- **Tools**: Functions the agent can use to perform tasks
- **Knowledge Base**: Information the agent can access
- **Conversation History**: Context from previous interactions

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing Agents

### Creating Custom Tools

```python
class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name = "my_tool"
    description = "Description of what this tool does"
    
    def _run(self, input_data: str) -> str:
        # Tool implementation
        return "Tool result"
    
    async def _arun(self, input_data: str) -> str:
        # Async version
        return self._run(input_data)
```

### Modifying Agent Behavior

```python
# Create custom agent configuration
config = AgentConfig(
    name="MyCustomAgent",
    model_id="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
    system_prompt="You are a specialized agent that...",
    capabilities=["custom_capability"],
    tools=["my_tool"]
)
```

## üìä Learning Analytics

The platform tracks your progress and provides insights:

- **Exercise Completion**: Track which exercises you've completed
- **Agent Interactions**: Monitor your interactions with different agents
- **Learning Path**: See your progress through the learning modules
- **Performance Metrics**: Understand how well you're performing

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS Credentials Not Found**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
   ```

2. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Change the port in config/environments/development.env
   API_PORT=8001
   ```

3. **Module Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're in the correct directory and virtual environment
   cd genAI-labs/education
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
